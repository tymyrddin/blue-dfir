# iOS forensics

Applying the [fundamentals of iOS forensics](../notes/ios.md) for analysing an actual iPhone in "Operation JustEncase": 

Your crime taskforce has been investigating into the root cause of a recent outbreak of criminal activity. Although you've apprehended a Mr Brandon Hunter, you need to analyse the filesystem dump of his iPhone to find a lead into the gang.

Although the suspect's phone is locked with a passcode, you have been able to use a recent "Lockdown Certificate" from the suspect's computer, allowing you to create a [logical file system dump from an iPhone backup he made recently](../notes/ios-acquisition.md).
