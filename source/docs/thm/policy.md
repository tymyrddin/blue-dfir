# Acceptable Use Policy violation (KAPE)

Organisation X has an Acceptable Use Policy for their Portable Devices, including Laptops. This policy forbids users 
from connecting removable or Network drives, installing software from unknown locations, and connecting to unknown 
networks. It looks like one of the users has violated this policy. Can you help Organisation X find out if the user 
violated the Acceptable Use Policy on their device? 

Run KAPE with your desired Target and Module options.

Hint: You can use EZviewer placed in the EZtools folder on Desktop to open CSV files.
