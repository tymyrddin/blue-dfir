## BOB! THIS ISN'T A HORSE!

Your SOC has informed you that they have gathered a memory dump from a quarantined endpoint thought to have been 
compromised by a banking trojan masquerading as an Adobe document. Your job is to use your knowledge of threat 
intelligence and reverse engineering to perform memory forensics on the infected host.

You have been informed of a suspicious IP in connection to the file that could be helpful: `41.168.5.140`

The memory file is located in `/Scenarios/Investigations/Investigation-1.vmem`

## That Kind of Hurt my Feelings

You have been informed that your corporation has been hit with a chain of ransomware that has been hitting 
corporations internationally. Your team has already retrieved the decryption key and recovered from the attack. 
Still, your job is to perform post-incident analysis and identify what actors were at play and what occurred on 
your systems. You have been provided with a raw memory dump from your team to begin your analysis.

The memory file is located in `Scenarios/Investigations/Investigation-2.raw`
