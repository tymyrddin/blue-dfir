# Persistence mechanisms

Persistence helps a malware persist on a machine after startup or any other mechanism that would stop the malware 
from running.

## Cron Jobs

    cat /etc/crontab

## Service Startup

A list of services can be found in the `/etc/init.d` directory:

    ls /etc/init.d/

## .Bashrc

    cat ~/.bashrc

System wide settings:

    /etc/bash.bashrc
    /etc/profile
