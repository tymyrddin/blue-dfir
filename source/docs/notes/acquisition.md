# Memory acquisition

1. Make sure a write blocker is attached/active.
2. Identify devices, partitions, input and output files, and parameters 
3. Make image
4. Hash the evidence before and during, or after, acquisition to provide proof that it was not tampered with.

## Linux

On the command-line, use `dd`, the data dump tool, and/or`dc3dd`, the enhancement of `dd`. Guymager, has built-in case-management abilities and also has many functional similarities to `dc3dd`, but it comes as a GUI tool and may be easier to use.

## Windows

On Windows, use FTK Imager (RAM and disk images) or Belkasoft Ram Capturer (only RAM acquisition).
