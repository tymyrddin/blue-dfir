# First responder

A dedicated first responder who is alerted and called to the scene usually has some knowledge or understanding of the workings of devices, networks, and perhaps even of the IT infrastructure in the community or organisation, if applicable. First responders do not have to be may not be skilled in digital forensics or digital investigations.

First responders are responsible for securing the scene and ensuring that the data, peripherals, equipment, and storage are not used, tampered with, removed, or compromised by unauthorised individuals, so as not to compromise a possible investigation.

Documentation of the scene is usually also done by first responders to aid in further investigations. Documentation of the scene can include photographs, video, voice recording, and manual documentation of:

* The room where the device is located (desk, ceiling, entrance/exit, windows, lighting, electrical outlets, and data drops)
* The state of the device (on, off, power light blinking)
* The screen contents and whether the device is on (operating system, running programs, date and time, wired and/or wireless network connectivity)
* Books, notes, and pieces of paper
* Connected and disconnected cables

Once the scene has been secured and documented, the forensic investigation can start: the process of acquiring what can be considered as physical evidence, for example:

* Computer system units
* Laptops
* Tablets
* Fixed and removable storage media
* Cables and chargers
