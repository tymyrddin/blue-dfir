# Analysis in general

In the analysis phase, the digital objects to be used as digital evidence to support or refute a hypothesis of a crime, incident, or event, are determined. For example:

* Identifying and fingerprinting devices, operating systems, and running services.
* Analysing memory dumps to discover traces of ransomware.
* Swap analysis.
* Password dumping.
* Examining a Firefox browser and Gmail artifacts.

Statistical methods, manual analysis, techniques for understanding protocols and data formats, linking of multiple data objects (for example with data mining), and timelining are some of the techniques that are used during analysis.
