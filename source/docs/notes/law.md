## The International Legal Framework of Cybercrime Law

The Council of Europe [Convention on Cybercrime](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list?module=treaty-detail&treatynum=185) (also known as the Budapest Convention) is, afaik, at present still the main international instrument on cybercrime. It aims to help its state parties harmonise their national laws, improve their investigative techniques and increase cooperation. In addition to most EU countries, the US, Japan, Australia, Canada and others have [ratified the convention](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list?module=signatures-by-treaty&treatynum=185). 

Also see [Cybercrime Legislation Worldwide](https://unctad.org/page/cybercrime-legislation-worldwide) for which countries have enacted cybercrime legislation.
