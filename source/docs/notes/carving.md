# File recovery and data carving

File recovery techniques make use of the file system information and, by using this information, many files can be recovered. If the information is not correct, then it will not work. Data carving works only on raw data on the media and is not connected with file system structure. Data carving doesnâ€™t care about any file systems which is used for storing files and is widely used for recovering deleted files and restoring valuable information from corrupted drives.

Always use multiple tools to ensure that the results are accurate by comparing the results of the tools used. And keep a log of tool testing for verification of the findings.
